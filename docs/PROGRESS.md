## 2026-09-27 · ALIGN · Alignment session (no code)
- Done: reviewed CLAUDE.md, SPEC and PLAN; architecture read-back; top-5 risk review; spec review for gaps and outdated details; interview with Malek on Phases 0 to 2. Updated `docs/SPEC.md` (v0.2: new §2.1, §2.2, §4.1, §4.2, §16, plus edits in §5, §6.2, §7, §8, §9.1, §10, §11, §12, §15), `CLAUDE.md` (stack, versions, dev environment) and the `docs/PLAN.md` task lines that the decisions change (P0.6, P1.1, P1.3, P1.6, P1.7, P2.0, P2.1, P2.6, P4.6, P5.3, acceptance lines). No code written.
- Decisions (details in SPEC §16):
  - D1: native Windows + Docker Desktop, no WSL. So no bash, TypeScript scripts via `tsx`, POSIX repo paths in all logic, LF endings, Windows CI job for unit tests, `heal:local` in a Linux container.
  - D2: Better Auth instead of Auth.js.
  - D3: tenants are orgs and personal accounts; the installer becomes OWNER after a verified sign-in; everyone else is invite-only.
  - D4: one failure per repo + commit, 5-minute collection window, one attempt and one PR per broken commit.
  - D5: watched workflows are opt-in per workflow with CI-looking ones pre-selected; the flaky re-run happens once, on failed jobs only, never where a job uses `environment:`.
  - D6: dev Anthropic workspace with a hard spend cap; automated tests never call the real API.
  - D7: engineering defaults: versions (Node 24, TS 6.0.x, Prisma 7.10.x, Next 16), healer path `.github/workflows/pipeheal.yml`, runner hardening, OIDC `actor`/`run_id` binding, state timeouts + delivery reconciler, snapshot/fixture test globs, no auth bypass in local mode.
- Environment notes (cloud session, for reference only since development runs on Malek's laptop): Node 22.22, pnpm 10.33; Docker CLI/Compose installed but the daemon has to be started by hand, after which `docker compose up` works. Docker Hub rate-limits anonymous pulls at times (mirror.gcr.io and public.ecr.aws work). smee.io and token.actions.githubusercontent.com are blocked by that environment's network policy.
- Follow-ups:
  - Phase-tagged open questions added to SPEC §15. Before P1.4: label permission. Before P1.3: storing user tokens. Before P3.3: policy defaults vs guardrails.
  - [HUMAN] at CHECKPOINT 1a: also create the Anthropic dev workspace with a spend limit (steps to be given then).
  - P0.6: GitHub may refuse `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pushed from a cloud session if the Claude GitHub App lacks workflow permission. From the laptop this doesn't apply.
